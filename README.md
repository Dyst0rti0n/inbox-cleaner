## Why I Built This Tool

I'm gonna be honest, my inbox is a mess.

* I didn‚Äôt sign up for 90% of the crap I'm receiving.
* The ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù button in Gmail is buried and slow as fuck to get shit done.
* Most so-called "email cleaning tools" are:

  * **Paywalled**
  * Built for corporate newsletters, not everyday chaos
  * Lacking context or transparency (what's being deleted? what‚Äôs blocked?)
  * More interested in selling you upgrades than actually cleaning your inbox

They don‚Äôt **show you what‚Äôs happening** and they often just archive your emails instead of blocking or actually unsubscribing which happened to me. That‚Äôs not cleaning.

## What Makes Inbox Cleaner Different

**Inbox Cleaner** is built by someone who was sick to death of that.

* You can **see every sender**, subject, and unsubscribe link before taking action.
* You can **block** senders permanently with one click.
* You can **unsubscribe** from annoying emails instantly, even from multiple at once.
* The interface is a **fast, no-nonsense GUI**
* All logic is **local and transparent**
* It remembers what you've unsubscribed from to prevent repetition and wasted clicks.
* And it‚Äôs completely **free and open source.**

This is the email cleaner **I wish Gmail shipped by default**.

##  Roadmap

## Core Functionality (COMPLETED)

* [x] Authenticate with Gmail API using OAuth 2.0
* [x] Display a list of emails with `List-Unsubscribe` headers
* [x] Parse and extract unsubscribe links (HTTP + mailto)
* [x] Add "Unsubscribe" and "Block" functionality via Gmail filters
* [x] Build cyberpunk-themed Tkinter GUI
* [x] Smart deduplication of brands by sender address
* [x] Skip already-blocked or unsubscribed emails (via `get_blocked_addresses()` and `get_unsubscribed()`)

---

## QoLI (In Progress)

* [ ] Add "Refresh Inbox" button to reload subscriptions live
* [ ] Highlight already-unsubscribed senders visually
* [ ] Add search/filter bar to quickly find specific brands
* [ ] Save unsubscribed/blocked sender emails to local cache (e.g. JSON or SQLite)
* [ ] Confirmations in GUI for completed actions (e.g. "Unsubscribed from X")

---

## Automation

* [ ] Add headless unsubscribe automation for common link patterns
* [ ] Intelligent sender grouping (e.g. same domain, subdomains)
* [ ] AI-based subject line classifier (e.g. spam/promos/ads)
* [ ] Stats dashboard: how many senders unsubscribed/blocked over time
* [ ] Export unsubscribe/block reports as `.csv` or `.json`

---

## User & Dev Tools

* [ ] CLI version (`python email_cleaner.py --unsub --block --report`), unnecessary? Maybe just Linux support but who's wanting to be using this
* [ ] Build `.exe` binary using PyInstaller for easy Windows execution
* [ ] Add complete customisation through settings
* [ ] Add logging + error tracking system (e.g. log to `logs/errors.log`)
* [ ] Add support across most email providers

---

## Future

* [ ] Full dark mode toggle
* [ ] Multi-account selector
* [ ] Browser extension
* [ ] Plugin system (e.g. add new unsubscribe scrapers or visual themes)
* [ ] Gmail label management
* [ ] Add test harness using mock Gmail API responses

---

## Inspiration

* Gmail‚Äôs awful native "Unsubscribe" UX
* The cyberpunk aesthetic of tools like *Terminus* and *NeoMutt*
* The need to take back control of our digital lives | clean inbox = clean mind
